VTODO spec: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545#section-3.6.2
vdir spec: https://vdirsyncer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/vdir.html

Looks like i'm overthinking this...
Instead of trying to convert ical component into ToDo and then back without loosing data,
i should use the decoded ical data as a single source and provide printing functions
that format the given component.

- [ ] add tests for vdir package
- [x] read about priority ical spec

ENCODING
- [x] use a NewToDo func similar to NewEvent in go-ical
- [x] generate UID of specific format?
- [ ] store non-relevant components in a separate field to keep them during encode

FILES
- recurse into dirs in path

DECODING
- [ ] parse #tags in description
- [x] (not needed for nor) make a map of [UID]ToDo instead of slice

CONFIG OPTIONS
- list of dirs to parse todos
- default list
- components displayed on list cmd (date, description etc)
