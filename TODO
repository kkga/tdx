VTODO spec: https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545#section-3.6.2
vdir spec: https://vdirsyncer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/vdir.html

Looks like i'm overthinking this...
Instead of trying to convert ical component into ToDo and then back without loosing data,
i should use the decoded ical data as a single source and provide printing functions
that format the given component.
